Choose the right branch
-----------------------

Before open your pull request, you must determine on which branch you need to
work.

 * if it contains a fix, refactoring or simply some code improvements must be
   opened against latest minor release branch. If latest stable version is
   `v2.2.3`, pull request must be opened starting from branch 2.2;
     
   * once new branch is merged to version 2.2 a new tag can should be created
     in this branch.

   * every time new version is released, that version must be merged to the
     upper minor branch (if exists) until master branch. This allow to keep all
     version fixed and also the next one;

 * if it contains new features must be opened against master branch;

Coding Standards
----------------

 * every time new class or method is added, `@since` annotation should be
   present. Just mark the minor version. `/** @since version x.y */`;

 * always use yoda condition;

 * respect PSR-2 coding standards;
